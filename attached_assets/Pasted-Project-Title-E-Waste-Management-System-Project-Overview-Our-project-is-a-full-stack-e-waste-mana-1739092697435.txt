Project Title:
E-Waste Management System

Project Overview:
Our project is a full-stack e‑waste management system designed to revolutionize how electronic waste is handled, processed, and repurposed. The platform connects various stakeholders—including regular users, recyclers, technicians, educators, business users, and admins—in a centralized, role-based ecosystem. The system enables each user type to register, log in, and, based on their role, be redirected to their corresponding dashboard where they can access tailored functionalities.

Key Features:

User Management & Authentication:

Registration & Login:
Users can register by providing their name, email, password, and selecting a role (e.g., User, Recycler, Technician, Educator, Admin, Business).
Upon login, the system authenticates the user and queries the database to determine their role. Based on the role, the user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard.
Roles Include:
Regular Users: Can request e‑waste pickups, track requests, view notifications, and access educational content.
Recyclers: Can view and manage pickup requests, see details of e‑waste items, and track recycling performance.
Technicians: Can manage repair or refurbishment tasks, update item statuses, and mark tasks as complete.
Educators: Can upload and manage educational resources on e‑waste, run awareness campaigns, and monitor content engagement.
Business Users: Can request bulk pickups, track CSR contributions, and manage company-specific recycling data.
Admins: Have overarching control to manage users, review and approve pickup requests, monitor support tickets, manage promotions, and generate analytical reports.
E-Waste Collection & Processing:

Pickup Requests:
Users submit requests to have their e‑waste collected, specifying the pickup address and scheduling details.
Recycling Centers:
Recyclers update the status of pickup requests and process e‑waste items, ensuring they are handled responsibly.
Marketplace & Order Processing:

E-Waste Items:
The system tracks items (including refurbished electronics) with details such as category, condition, pricing, and quantity.
Cart & Orders:
Users can add items to a cart, place orders, and leave feedback for products.
Gamification & Environmental Impact:

Rewards & Leaderboard:
Users earn points for recycling and can see their ranking on a leaderboard.
Carbon Footprint Tracker:
The system calculates and displays the environmental impact (e.g., CO₂ saved) of users’ recycling efforts.
Communication & Support:

Support Tickets & Notifications:
Users can submit support queries, and the system sends notifications about request status, promotions, and educational updates.
Promotions & Educational Content:
Dedicated modules for managing special offers and educational materials.
Workflow Summary:

Landing Page:
Users arrive at the index page which offers clear options for registration and login.

Registration Flow:

A registration form collects name, email, password, and user role.
Upon submission, the user data (with a hashed password) is stored in the database.
A successful registration directs users to the login page.
Login Flow:

Users log in with their email and password.
The system authenticates the user and then queries the database for their role.
Based on the role (e.g., admin, recycler, technician, educator, or user), the system redirects the user to their corresponding dashboard.
Role-Specific Dashboards:

Admin Dashboard:
Allows management of users, pickup requests, support tickets, promotions, and overall system reports.
Recycler Dashboard:
Displays pickup requests, e‑waste item details, and recycling performance stats.
Technician Dashboard:
Shows repair/refurbishment tasks and allows status updates.
User Dashboard:
Enables users to request pickups, view past requests, track rewards and environmental impact, and access educational resources.
Educator Dashboard:
Permits educators to upload and manage educational content, run workshops, and view engagement metrics.
Business Dashboard:
Helps business users submit bulk pickup requests, track CSR contributions, and manage company-specific data.

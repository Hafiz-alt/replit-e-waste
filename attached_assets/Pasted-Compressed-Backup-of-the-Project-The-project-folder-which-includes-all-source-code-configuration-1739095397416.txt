Compressed Backup of the Project:

The project folder (which includes all source code, configuration files, and assets) must be compressed into a ZIP file as a complete backup. This backup will help in version control, migration, or restoring the project if needed.
User Registration & Authentication:

All user roles (user, recycler, technician, educator, admin, and business) can register and log in.
Registered user details (name, email, hashed password, role, created_at, etc.) are stored in the database.
Upon login, users are redirected to role-specific dashboards.
Role-Based Dashboards:

User Dashboard:
Users can submit pickup requests by entering the pickup address and preferred date.
Once a request is submitted, a notification is sent to the Recycler Dashboard.
Additional features include viewing notifications, rewards, and environmental impact (e.g., carbon footprint saved).
Recycler Dashboard:
Displays incoming pickup requests from users.
Allows recyclers to view details such as pickup address, requested date, and type of e‑waste.
Receives notifications from user pickup requests.
Technician Dashboard:
Displays repair or refurbishment tasks assigned to technicians.
Enables technicians to update the status of repair tasks and communicate with users.
Educator Dashboard:
Allows educators to manage and publish educational content (articles, videos, infographics).
Tracks engagement metrics and responds to user queries.
Admin Dashboard:
Provides system-wide management: user management, monitoring pickup requests, managing support tickets, promotions, and generating reports.
Business Dashboard (Optional):
Enables business users to submit bulk pickup requests and track corporate recycling data.
Interactive Workflow Enhancements:

Dynamic Pickup Request Workflow:
When a user submits a pickup request (entering the pickup address and preferred date and clicking "Submit Request"), the system should create a new pickup request in the database.
A notification must be dynamically pushed to the Recycler Dashboard so that recyclers can see and manage these requests in real time.
Chatbot Integration for Dynamic Communication:
Implement a dynamic chatbot facility that enables real-time communication between:
Recyclers and Users: To coordinate pickup details.
Technicians and Users: To discuss repair/refurbishment queries.
Integrate the Deepseek R1 API key (or similar AI-powered chatbot API) to handle and clear user queries. This chatbot should be embedded in the relevant dashboards as a floating widget or a dedicated chat panel.
Marketplace Module:
Allow users to list their refurbished e‑waste for sale. The marketplace should include:
A form to create new listings (item name, description, price, condition, photos).
A public view where other users can browse available items.
Order processing where users can purchase listed items and provide feedback.
Ensure that marketplace orders and feedback are stored in the database and are accessible via the respective dashboards.
